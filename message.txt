Dear Vherlyn, ♥  (❀❛ ֊ ❛„)♡𓆩 ♡ 𓆪.

There's something special I want to share with you. I know this might come as a surprise, 
and I understand if you need time to process it. I just need to get this out of my head for my peace of mind. I fully respect whatever your decision might be.

As much as it hurts to say goodbye, I know it's for the best. Our journey together has been filled with beautiful moments, laughter, and love that I'll always cherish. Though we're parting ways now, please know that you'll forever hold a special place in my heart.

I'll treasure the memories we've created and the lessons we've learned together. Thank you for everything you've brought into my life, for the love, support, and understanding you've shown me.

As we go our separate paths, I wish you nothing but happiness and fulfillment. May you find the love and joy you deserve, and may your dreams and aspirations come true. Take care of yourself, and may life bring you endless blessings and opportunities.

Farewell, Vherlyn. Take good care of yourself, my dear. Remember to nurture your mind, body, and soul. Prioritize your well-being, indulge in self-care, and embrace moments of peace and joy. You are precious, and your happiness matters. Wishing you love, strength, and all the goodness life has to offer. Until we meet again, take care. Know that you'll always be remembered fondly and that I'll carry the love we shared with me wherever I go.

With sincerest affection,

Ace B.
